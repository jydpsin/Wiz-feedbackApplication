Objective:

Demonstrate your proficiency in deploying and managing cloud-based solutions by setting
up a three-tiered web application in the cloud platform of your choice.
Your approach, the challenges faced, and your solutions will be essential components for
the presentation portion of this task, along with your ability to effectively communicate the
technical details.
You can choose the cloud environment of your preference, but we encourage you to pick
an environment that isn't your strongest. This offers a better insight into your problem-
solving and adaptability skills. The Wiz recruiter working with you will provide instructions
on how to access the CloudLabs environment for the build-out. You will have the option to
choose from AWS, Azure or GCP.


Environment Requirements:


Web Application Tier: A containerized web application deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
Database Tier: MongoDB server set up on a VM configured for access by the Kubernetes
cluster.
Storage Tier: Object storage configured to hold MongoDB backups and set with public
read permissions.
